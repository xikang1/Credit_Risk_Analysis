# Credit_Risk_Analysis
machine learning 

## Overview
In this project, we have employed different techniques to train and evaluate models. We have oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Moreover, we have combined both oversampling and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm to evaluate the model performance. We have also applied two new algorithms :BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. We would make evaluation of the performance of all algorithms and choose the one algorithm to predict credit risk with the highest accuracy.

## Results

## Summary


Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
